# Expo SDK integration

This guide targets SDK release `0.2.0`. Inspect the app's existing notification
integration before changing startup or callback ownership. Use the public project
UUID from the dashboard, never a server API key. Configure matching FCM/APNs
providers in the dashboard; MCP does not configure provider credentials.

Canonical source: [this guide](https://github.com/TheBoldApps/notification.dev-SDKs/blob/main/docs/integration/expo.md).
The [platform README](https://github.com/TheBoldApps/notification.dev-SDKs/blob/main/expo/README.md) covers released installation and usage.

TypeScript API over the **released** notification.dev native SDKs. Android uses
`dev.notification:android-sdk:0.2.0` from Maven Central. iOS uses the remote
`NotificationDev` Swift package at exact version `0.2.0`, including its
checksum-verified Kotlin core XCFramework. The npm package contains bridge and
configuration code only, with no native SDK sources or binaries.

Initial compatibility: Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86, Android API 24+, iOS
16.4+, and Apple Silicon simulators. Requires a development or production build;
Expo Go, web, and desktop are unsupported. Bare React Native apps require Expo
modules and equivalent native configuration.

The plugin selects Kotlin `2.3.20` to match the released native SDK. Remove
conflicting Kotlin overrides before prebuild.

## Install and configure

```sh
npx expo install @notification.dev/expo
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

Add the plugin and Android Firebase configuration to `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": { "bundleIdentifier": "com.example.app" },
    "android": {
      "package": "com.example.app",
      "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json"
    },
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@notification.dev/expo",
        {
          "projectId": "YOUR_PUBLIC_PROJECT_UUID"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Use a real UUID for `projectId`. Configure matching FCM/APNs providers in
notification.dev and push signing for the iOS bundle ID. Provider credentials
stay on the server. Expo's Google Services configuration handles the Android
file and Gradle plugin. Direct FCM/APNs tokens are used, without Expo Push Service.

The plugin adds native startup configuration, notification permission, a default
Android icon, push entitlements, and an idempotent CocoaPods post-install hook.
React Native attaches the **remote Swift package** to the bridge; the hook
registers its release in the app workspace without linking the static product
twice. CocoaPods installs the Expo bridge/dependencies; SPM resolves the native
notification.dev SDK. Consuming iOS apps need no Kotlin build or SDK checkout.

Build locally with `npx expo run:android` / `npx expo run:ios`, or use EAS Build.
After changing native dependencies or plugin configuration, regenerate with
`npx expo prebuild --clean` and rebuild. Clean prebuild removes handwritten edits
in generated native directories; keep customizations in plugins.

| Plugin option         | Default                         | Meaning                                          |

| `androidIcon`         | Built-in bell                   | Monochrome transparent PNG path                  |
| `androidChannelId`    | `notification_dev`              | Notification channel ID                          |
| `androidChannelName`  | `Notifications`                 | Channel display name                             |
| `displayInForeground` | `true`                          | Show eligible foreground notifications           |
| `loggingEnabled`      | `false`                         | Sanitized native logging                         |
| `allowHttp`           | `false`                         | Allow HTTP and configure OS transport exceptions |

Configuration is baked into the native app and applies on every process startup,
before JavaScript, including background Firebase startup. Change it with a new
native build; OTA JavaScript cannot switch projects/API hosts. Clear development
app data when changing projects or API hosts.

## Use

```ts
import { NotificationDev } from "@notification.dev/expo";

const sdk = await NotificationDev.initialize();
const states = sdk.addListener("states", (state) => console.log(state));
const errors = sdk.addListener("diagnostics", (error) =>
  console.log(error.code),
);
await sdk.login("opaque-customer-id");
await sdk.setTags({ plan: "premium", paid: true });
await sdk.setEmail("customer@example.com", true);
await sdk.setPushOptedIn(true);
await sdk.track("checkout", { total: 42 });

// Call from an explicit user action:
await sdk.requestPushPermission();

// On unmount:
states.remove();
errors.remove();
```

Initialization waits for local readiness, not server registration. Methods reject
with `SdkException` (`code`, `message`). Tags accept strings, booleans, and finite
numbers; event properties accept finite JSON. `getState()`, `getTags()`, and
`getEmail()` read locally; `refresh()` fetches server state.

`states` and `pendingOpens` replay their latest snapshots. `notifications` and
`diagnostics` are live events. Subscriptions share one native event listener and
stop native collectors when the last subscription is removed. The native SDK
continues working independently of JavaScript reloads and subscriptions.

## Handle notification opens

`pendingOpens` is the notification-open callback/stream. It emits a list of
unacknowledged taps, including taps that launched the app. Subscribe once in your
app's navigation layer after initialization. `notifications` reports received
notifications; use `pendingOpens` for taps.

Opens replay until acknowledged. Handle them serially, wait for navigation to be
ready, and acknowledge only after successful handling. The SDK does not launch
deep links automatically. `open.notification.deepLink` and
`open.notification.data` contain your routing information.

```ts
const navigated = new Set<string>();
let active = true;
let queue = Promise.resolve();
const opens = sdk.addListener("pendingOpens", (pending) => {
  queue = queue.then(async () => {
    for (const open of pending) {
      if (!active) return;
      if (!navigated.has(open.interactionId)) {
        await waitForNavigationReady();
        if (!active) return;
        await navigateFromNotification(open.notification.deepLink, open.notification.data);
        navigated.add(open.interactionId);
      }
      await sdk.acknowledgeOpen(open.interactionId);
    }
  }).catch((error) => {
    reportOpenError(error);
  });
});

// When the navigation owner unmounts:
// active = false;
// opens.remove();
```

The promise queue serializes snapshots and catches handling failures. Keep one
active subscription in your navigation owner and remove it on unmount. Native
integration forwards tap callbacks automatically.

The app supplies `waitForNavigationReady`, `navigateFromNotification`, and
`reportOpenError`; navigation must finish successfully before returning. Route
only links/data your app supports. The handled-ID set prevents repeated navigation
when snapshots replay during acknowledgment; retain it for the observer's lifetime.
On failure, the open remains pending. Retry through your app's retry flow or by
restarting the observer; a new snapshot is not guaranteed immediately.

## Notification ownership

Other methods include `logout()`, `removeTags(keys)`, `removeEmail()`,
`setEmailOptedIn(enabled)`, `getPushPermissionStatus()`, and `openPushSettings()`.
Opening settings does not confirm permission.

This version requires exclusive push callback ownership. Do not combine it with
`expo-notifications`, `@react-native-firebase/messaging`, a custom Firebase service,
or another notification center delegate. The plugin rejects known conflicting
packages; iOS reports delegate conflicts. Manual integration is not supported.

See [shared semantics](https://github.com/TheBoldApps/notification.dev-SDKs/blob/main/README.md#shared-behavior) and
[payload formats](https://github.com/TheBoldApps/notification.dev-SDKs/blob/main/contract/README.md#push-payloads). Android requires data-only
FCM, without an FCM `notification` block. iOS background alerts can appear before
SDK checks; pending sync resumes when the OS permits execution.

## Shared identity and synchronization behavior

Initialize once per process with stable configuration. Initialization establishes
local readiness; inspect state and diagnostics for server registration and sync
failures. Setters update local state and queue synchronization rather than proving
server acceptance. `refresh()` retains pending local edits.

Tags and email belong to the user; push preference belongs to the installation.
Email preference, push preference, and OS permission are independent. Login uses
unverified external IDs: use opaque random IDs and retry the same ID after an
ambiguous result. Association changes discard pending work; logout creates a new
anonymous association without unsubscribing the old user's email.

Events persist offline and retry for up to seven days. App opens are automatic;
`notification_dev.app_opened` and `notification_dev.subscriber_created` are reserved.
Pending notification opens replay until acknowledged. Serialize navigation,
deduplicate in-flight work by `interactionId`, and acknowledge only after handling
the open. The SDK does not launch deep links automatically.

## Verify the integration

Use a disposable project and a signed app on a device with matching providers:

1. Start the app and inspect registration, push token status, sync state, and diagnostics.
2. Request permission from a user action, enable SDK push preference, and verify the
   installation appears in the dashboard. Also test denial and return from settings.
3. Send a campaign from the dashboard while foregrounded and backgrounded. Android
   requires data-only FCM; Firebase console notification messages do not exercise
   the SDK path. Provider acceptance alone does not prove device delivery.
4. Tap a notification while running, backgrounded, and after process termination.
   Verify routing, replay before acknowledgment, and no replay after acknowledgment.
   Android force-stop prevents delivery until the app is opened again.
5. Edit tags/email and track an event offline; restart and reconnect, then verify
   sync. Log in/out and verify the new association and notification handling.

## Troubleshooting

- No server registration: verify the project UUID and API host, inspect diagnostics
  and pending state, and check network access. Keep provider secrets on the server.
- Registered but no push: check OS permission, SDK push preference, token status,
  provider credentials, Android Firebase project, and iOS bundle ID/environment.
- Missing opens: check callback ownership and forwarding, subscribe to pending
  opens at app startup, and avoid acknowledging before navigation completes.
- Local storage failure: inspect the diagnostic code; iOS needs signing and
  Keychain access. Clear development app data when changing projects or hosts.
- HTTP development backend: explicitly allow HTTP in SDK configuration and host OS
  transport policy. Android emulators reach the host at `10.0.2.2`; iOS simulators
  can use `localhost`. Keep production endpoints on HTTPS.
